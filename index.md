<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Meta AI, under the supervision of Prof. Maja Pantic and Dr. Stavros Petridis. Prior to joining Meta in 2022, I earned my Ph.D. from Pompeu Fabra University in 2021, my M.Sc. from Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2016, and my B.Sc. from Pompeu Fabra University in 2015. My research interests lie in the areas of computer vision and speech processing to deeper understand human behavior. Currently, my focus is on the compression and optimization of audio-visual speech recognition models and generative models through the use of sparse networks. </p>
