I am a data and applied scientist at Microsoft AI. Prior to joining Microsoft, I conducted postdoctoral research at Meta AI for over 2 years, under the supervision of Prof. Maja Pantic and Dr. Stavros Petridis. I completed my Ph.D. from Pompeu Fabra University in 2021 and my M.Sc. from Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2016. I am passionate about research in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about the compression and optimization of neural networks in both training and inference setups. I enjoy working in this field because of the endless opportunities to innovate and make a positive impact on technology and society. </p>
